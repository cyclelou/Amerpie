# Ben Lovejoy

quote:: It smiled at you as it started-up. You didn't have directory listings, you had images of folders. You didn't type the name of an application or file to open it, you used this strange new thing called a mouse to double-click it. When you made a word bold, it appeared in bold on the screen. You had different typefaces! It could talk to you! [â€¦]

quote:: I immediately knew this was what computers were supposed to be like. I wanted one.
