# C. S. Lewis

quote:: The way for a person to develop a writing style is (a) to know exactly what he wants to say, and (b) to be sure he is saying exactly that. The reader, we must remember, does not start by knowing what we mean. If our words are ambiguous, our meaning will escape him. I sometimes think that writing is like driving sheep down a road. If there is any gate open to the left or the right the readers will most certainly go into it.

quote:: When the whole world is running towards a cliff, he who is running in the opposite direction appears to have lost his mind.

quote:: Nearly all vices are rooted in the future. Gratitude looks to the past and love to the present; fear, avarice, lust and ambition look ahead. (Screwtape)

quote:: Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.  
^torment

quote:: Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.  
^tyranny

quote: When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.

quote: People who bore one another should meet seldom; people who interest each other, often.

quote: Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.  
^original  
quote: Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.  
^integrity

quote: Whatever you do, He will make good of it. But not the good He had prepared for you if you had obeyed him. ([[Perelandra]]) ^good

quote: If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been proof that you were not.

quote: The only things we can keep are the things we freely give to God. What we try to keep for ourselves is just what we are sure to lose.

quote: Do I think well of myself, think myself a nice chap? Well, I am afraid I sometimes do (and those are, no doubt, my worst moments)

quote: There might be things more terrible even than losing someone you love to death.  
^death

quote: The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers of love is Hell.

quote: True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less.

quote: Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like artâ€¦ It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things that give value to survival.  
^friendship

quote: Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.  
^courage

quote: Progress, for me, means increasing goodness and happiness of individual lives. For the species, as for each man, mere longevity seems to me a contemptible ideal. ^progress
