# Hugh MacLeod

[[+Quotes MOC|Quotes]]

The price of being a sheep is boredom. The price of being a wolf is loneliness. Choose one or the other with great care.

Being good at anything is like figure skatingâ€”the definition of being good at it is being able to make it look easy. But it never is easy. Ever. That's what the stupidly wrong people coveniently forget.
