# Marcel Proust

[[+Quotes MOC|Quotes]]

Come now! â€¦ were everything clear, all would seem to you vain. Your boredom would populate a shadowless universe with an impassive life made up of unleavened souls. But a measure of disquiet is a divine gift. The hope which, in your eyes, shines on a dark threshold does not have its basis in an overly certain world.  
From By Way Of Sainte-Beuve

# Marcus Aurelius

If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and thus you have the power to revoke it at any moment.

A man must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.

When thou hast trouble in getting up, say to thyself: I awake to do the work of a man; why then should I grieve for having to do the things for which I was sent into the world? Was I born to remain warmly in bed under my covers? But it is so pleasant. Wert thou born for pleasure, then? Was it not for action, for work?

The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.

Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.
